Hello! This is a project I completed for my Advanced Programming in Java Course.  It
takes advantage of the serialization feature in Java to allow the user to add a number
of students to a serialized file, as well as load the serialized file and print it.

Users are given a six option menu, which appears as such: 

1: Print out all loaded students
2: Add student
3: Clear students
4: Save students to file
5: Load students from file
6: Quit

1) Prints a list of all students currently in the ArrayList 'students'. The list is sorted by 
name.

2) Adding a student allows you to add one student object to an ArrayList of students, which 
consists of a name, an ArrayList of test grades, an ArrayList of homework gardes, and a final 
grade.

3) Clears all student objects from the ArrayList 'students'.

4) Saves all students from ArrayList 'students' to a serialized file.

5) Loads all serialized data from the file of the user's choosing to the ArrayList 'students'

6) Quits the program
